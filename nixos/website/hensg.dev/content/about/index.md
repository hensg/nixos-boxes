### Employment History

**Software Engineer  
Fedi, Inc (Remote - Austin, Texas, US) | 2024 - Present**
- Developed a tool in Rust using Tokio and Tonic (gRPC) for handling Lightning payments between an internal LND node and Fedimint Federation clients, with automatic fund return.
- Integrated metrics to monitor transaction times and implemented alerts to detect payment failures or delays.
- Built a Rust-based API with Tokio to expose payment fee information to a mobile application. 
- Built a Lightning Node (LND) invoice scraper in Rust with Tonic (Protobuf), SQLx and PostgreSQL.
- Contributed to projects related to device data storage (KeyValue API) and Matrix Rust bot chat.
- Wrote Nix configurations for setting up Rust development environments, deploying backend services on NixOS (Bitcoin node, Lightning nodes, and Fedimint), and Kubernetes infrastructure with Longhorn.

**Software Engineer  
LogRock, Inc (Remote - Chicago, Illinois, US) | 2022 - 2024**
- Developed a data and document management system for trucking companies using Django and PostgreSQL, with Celery for background jobs and Kafka integration.
